Frecks Bertrand II is new to the software field as a whole and has much work to do to catch up to his contemporaries; however, he is willing and ready to work hard and has been putting in work everyday do learn what's necessary to succeed. Currently, he has experience in C and C++ and is working to learn coding in HTML/CSS.
Hobbies include making money, balling hard, and reading his Bible.
